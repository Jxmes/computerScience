## What is it?
`computerScience` is a collection of programs produced by Alfie ['A1fus'](twitter.com/a1fus)Bowman.

It contains an assortment of programs, from experiments to final productions. As a collective, it is clear to see how one idea led to the next and so forth.


## Projects


### arithmeticQuiz.py
`arithmeticQuiz` is a fully automated maths test. It produces a set of 10 randomly generated maths questions using `random.randint` from Python's default `random` module.

It asks for 2 numbers to be generated and an operator that can take a numerical value from 1-3. this is then corresponded to a particular operator that has already been defined.

Once 10 questions have been answered, it outputs the final score and gives an encouraging message to the user.
