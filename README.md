## What is it?
`computerScience` is a collection of programs produced by Alfie '[A1fus](twitter.com/a1fus)' Bowman.

It contains an assortment of programs, from experiments to final productions. As a collective, it is clear to see how one idea led to the next and so forth.


## Projects


### arithmeticQuiz.py
`arithmeticQuiz` is a fully automated maths test. It produces a set of 10 randomly generated maths questions using `random.randint` from Python's default `random` module.

#### About
It asks for 2 numbers to be generated and an operator that can take a numerical value from 1-3. this is then corresponded to a particular operator that has already been defined.

Once 10 questions have been answered, it outputs the final score and gives an encouraging message to the user.


#### Dependencies
* [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-342/)


#### Installation
Simply [download the ZIP](https://github.com/A1fus/computerScience/archive/master.zip) of this repo or, if you're fancy, [clone this repo](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/A1fus/computerScience) into  [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for your particular platform. From there execute the program with Python.

### bronzeCert.py


#### About
`bronzeCert` is an answer to questions listed in a task sheet. It uses the `print` function to display the line, 'hello, world'. it also uses the `print` function to show that when integers are placed in it, it prints the answer. It details the author and date of creation in a comment. Another comment is used to explain why comments might be useful. Finally, it shows that using `\n` in a string causes it to start a new line.


#### Dependencies
* [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-342/)


#### Installation
Simply [download the ZIP](https://github.com/A1fus/computerScience/archive/master.zip) of this repo or, if you're fancy, [clone this repo](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/A1fus/computerScience) into  [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for your particular platform. From there execute the program with Python.

### generalKnowledge.py


#### About
`generalKnowledge` is a basic quiz built in [Python](https://python.org/). It takes the user's name and asks them five questions based on current and past events. It has limitations, for exaple:

```python
if answerOne == "Tennessee":
    print("Correct! You scored a point (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞")
```

The quiz requires an exact string to be entered for the user to be given a point. This means that sometimes it can be difficult to get the correct answer.


#### Dependencies
* [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-342/)


#### Installation

From there execute the program with Python.

### goingLoopyWithPython.py


#### About
`goingLoopyWithPython` is my work for one of my early lessons. It is about using the `while` function to generate loops. The first loop it makes is `while` the `lines` variable is less than 50, it prints a string and adds 1 to the `lines` variable.

The next loop it makes is `while` the `value` variable is less than 101, it prints the value and adds one to it, creating a further incrementing loop.

The final loop that this program contains is the same as the one above, but uses a number entered by the user. It does this by using the `input()` function. In my first version of this program, it uses the `input()` soley, but I have since learnt that it takes the input as a string and the `input()` needs to be wrapped in an `int()`.

### pseudoArithmeticQuiz.md


#### About
This is a [Pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) version of my [arithmeticQuiz](https://github.com/A1fus/computerScience/blob/master/arithmeticQuiz.py). I created this as part of my Controlled Assessment task. It probably isn't a good example of how to use Pseudocode, nor does it accurately represent my code that well. Although it is a start.


#### Dependencies
It's a text document.


#### Installation
Simply [download the ZIP](https://github.com/A1fus/computerScience/archive/master.zip) of this repo or, if you're fancy, [clone this repo](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/A1fus/computerScience) into  [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for your particular platform.

### pseudoTeabags.md


#### About
`pseudoTeabags` is a first go at Pseudocode for me. It outlines the way to produce a very British cup of tea in a way that a simple robot might understand. It tries to follow some guidelines, such as making functions in BLOCK CAPS. Have a read and see what you think.


#### Dependencies
It's just a text document, nothing to run!
