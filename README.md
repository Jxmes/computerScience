## What is it?
`computerScience` is a collection of programs produced by Alfie '[A1fus](twitter.com/a1fus)' Bowman.

It contains an assortment of programs, from experiments to final productions. As a collective, it is clear to see how one idea led to the next and so forth.


## Projects


### arithmeticQuiz.py
`arithmeticQuiz` is a fully automated maths test. It produces a set of 10 randomly generated maths questions using `random.randint` from Python's default `random` module.

#### About
It asks for 2 numbers to be generated and an operator that can take a numerical value from 1-3. this is then corresponded to a particular operator that has already been defined.

Once 10 questions have been answered, it outputs the final score and gives an encouraging message to the user.

### bronzeCert.py


#### About
`bronzeCert` is an answer to questions listed in a task sheet. It uses the `print` function to display the line, 'hello, world'. it also uses the `print` function to show that when integers are placed in it, it prints the answer. It details the author and date of creation in a comment. Another comment is used to explain why comments might be useful. Finally, it shows that using `\n` in a string causes it to start a new line.
